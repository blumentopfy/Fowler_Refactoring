# Refactoring by Fowler

This project is done on following Chapter 1 of [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r95004/Refactoring_improving_the_design_of_existing_code.pdf) by Martin Fowler, Kent Beck (Contributor), John Brant (Contributor), William Opdyke, Don Roberts. This book is very helpful for advanced programmers to learn about refactoring their code. It also gives the reader step by step instructions on how to start refactoring.
